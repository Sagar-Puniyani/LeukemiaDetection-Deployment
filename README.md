# Blood Cancer Detection from Peripheral Blood Smear Images
## Using Deep Learning and Streamlit Interface

### Abstract
This project implements an automated system for detecting and classifying blood cancer (lymphoma) from peripheral blood smear (PBS) images using deep learning techniques. The system provides a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, allowing medical professionals to upload PBS images and receive instant predictions about the presence and severity of lymphoma.

### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Background
Blood cancer, particularly lymphoma, is a serious condition that requires early detection for effective treatment. Traditional manual microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears is time-consuming and subject to human error. This project aims to automate and enhance the detection process using artificial intelligence.

- Create a user-friendly interface for medical professionals
- Provide quick and accurate predictions for early diagnosis
- Reduce the manual effort required in PBS analysis

### 2. Methodology
#### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Collection of PBS image dataset
- Image preprocessing techniques applied:
  - Normalization
  - Resizing
  - Augmentation (if applicable)

#### 2.2 Model Architecture
- Description of the deep learning model used
- Network architecture details
- Training parameters and optimization techniques

#### 2.3 System Implementation
- Technologies used:
  - Python for model development
  - Deep learning framework (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
  - Streamlit for web interface
- System workflow:
  1. Image upload through web interface
  2. Image preprocessing
